1. The AI Engine: Expense & Invoice Automation
The standout feature of ZentroProp is its use of AI to eliminate manual data entry:

Email & Document Scanning: You can connect your Gmail or upload PDFs directly. The AI (integrated with OpenAI) extracts details like vendor names, amounts, due dates, and line items.

Smart Categorization: The AI suggests whether an expense should be categorized under a Rental (operating expense) or a Rehab (capital expenditure), ensuring your tax-ready reports and P&Ls are accurate.

Data Security: It uses secure OAuth tokens for email access, and according to their privacy policy, the AI only "sees" the data to structure it into your dashboard.

2. Unified Portfolio Management
The platform bridges the gap between property management and project management:

Mixed Tracking: It allows you to track rental income and leases side-by-side with rehab budgets and construction timelines.

Real-Time P&Ls: You get property-level Profit & Loss statements that factor in both ongoing rental yield and one-time renovation costs.

Cash Flow Analysis: Provides a consolidated view of your entire portfolio's performance, showing you where you are profitable and where budgets are "running away."

3. Pricing & Tiers
ZentroProp typically uses a flat-fee model based on the number of units, rather than charging for individual features. | Tier | Portfolio Size | Best For | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Base | Small Portfolios | Independent investors with a few rentals or flips. | | Middle | ~50 Units | Growing operators managing multiple projects at once. | | Pro | 51 - 150 Units | Firms and professional operators ($199/month). | | Enterprise | 150+ Units | Large-scale firms needing custom integrations. |
